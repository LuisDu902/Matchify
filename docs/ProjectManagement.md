## Project management
Common practices of managing iterative software development are: backlog management, release management, estimation, iteration planning, iteration development, acceptance tests, and retrospectives.

You can find below information and references related with the project management in our team: 

* Backlog management: Product backlog and Iteration backlog in a [Github Projects board](https://github.com/orgs/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/projects/29);

### Retrospective

#### What went well?

* Familiarization with the new technologies: Android Studio && Flutter;
* GitHub Flow went smoothly;
* We managed to implement most of what we had on the iteration backlog;
* We improved on what we had designed previously for the UI mockups;
* Good relationship between team members.


#### What should we do differently?

* Better communication;
* Better time management;
* Try to finish our goals fully;

#### What still puzzles us?

* Some of the Flutter syntax;
* Specifics of the Gherkin automated testing;
* Some quirks of Spotify SDK and Spotify Web API;
